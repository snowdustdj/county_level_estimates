# Using Small Area Estimation Techniques to Get County-Level Survey Results from State-level BRFSS Data
### Project proposal for the Data Incubator semi-finalist challenge.
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation’s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. This survey provides the government with crucial information about people’s health conditions for each state. Since it covers a broad range of health-related questions, some companies can also use the information to enhance their marketing strategy by targeting the right people. However, one drawback of this survey is that it only provides state-level estimates. There do exist difference within each state. Knowing the estimates at a finer scale, like at county-level, can be important for making decisions and more effective marketing strategies. In this project, we will build models using the BRFSS data to provide county-level estimates for all counties in the U.S. The feasibility has been tested using BRFSS data in Missouri.
